 * (`runs.json`, NDJSON) keeps the existing additive-zod convention and never
 * migrates. Rules, verbatim from the spec:
 *
 * - **idempotent** — every migration is safe to re-run after a crash mid-way;
 * - **additive** — never deletes or rewrites the user's per-repo files;
 * - **non-blocking** — a failing migration logs ONE warning and boot proceeds
 *   degraded with in-memory defaults; it is never a boot failure (the
 *   zero-config law "a read-only home degrades to a smaller cockpit" holds);
 * - **concurrency-safe** — every write takes the same read-modify-write +
 *   atomic-rename path as all workspace writes (`mergeWriteWorkspaceConfig`),
 *   and two processes racing the same idempotent step converge.

 * 2. Booting inside a repo: import its `maxParallel`/`memoryLimitMb` into

 *    defaults are applied), which is exactly what makes a crash-interrupted
 *    re-run safe: the first pass writes the keys, the re-run sees them set.
 * 3. Every per-repo file is left untouched in place, so an older cezar run in
 *    the same repo keeps working off its local copies.
 *
 * Registering the boot repo is NOT part of the migration — the normal boot
 * flow owns registration (single owner, no divergent `addedAt`/`source`).

/**
 * `GET /api/fs/browse` — the directory picker behind "Add project → open local
 * folder" (spec 2026-07-20-multi-project-workspace, step 4.1).
 *
 * This is the one route that hands the operator's filesystem shape to a
 * browser, so the whole module is written around a single containment rule and
 * nothing else:
 *
 *   **every path this route answers about — the one browsed and every entry
 *   listed — must be the browse root itself or live strictly beneath it, as
 *   judged AFTER `realpath()` resolved the whole symlink chain.**
 *
 * Why realpath and not `resolve()`: `resolve()` only normalizes `..` textually.
 * It cannot see that `~/tmp/escape` is a symlink to `/etc`, so a lexical-only
 * check happily lists `/etc` under a path that spells as being inside home.
 * The lexical check is still done FIRST (it rejects `..` traversal and absolute
 * escapes without touching the disk at all, and it keeps a probe for
 * "does /root exist" from ever reaching the filesystem), and the realpath check
 * is done SECOND as the authoritative one.
 *
 * Two more deliberate choices:
 *
 * - **Directories only.** Files are never listed, never stat-reported, never
 *   read. The picker's job is to name a folder; a file name is already more of
 *   the operator's disk than the caller needs.
 * - **Errors never echo a resolved path.** `{ error }` says what the caller did
 *   wrong, never where they landed — an error string carrying the realpath of
 *   an escape attempt would be the very leak the containment prevents (same
 *   reasoning as the `/api/health` `repoRoot` trim, #431).

 * root". This split lets the register route reject out-of-root paths UNIFORMLY (the existence
 * oracle stays shut, because a spelling outside the root is refused whether or not it exists),
 * then answer honestly about existence, then still catch symlink escapes with the realpath gate.

/**
 * The typed client, end to end (spec 2026-07-23-independent-server-web-packages, Phase 1).
 *
 * This is the test the hand-written mirror (`packages/api-client/src/dto/types.ts`) and its drift guard
 * exist to replace. It proves the two halves of the claim "the routes ARE the contract":
 *
 *   1. RUNTIME — a client built from `AppType` reaches the real handlers and gets the real
 *      answers. The client's `fetch` is wired straight into the app, so no port is opened and
 *      nothing is stubbed: the response comes out of the same code a browser would hit.
 *   2. COMPILE TIME — the response type is inferred from the handler's `c.json(...)`, not
 *      declared here, and a path the service does not serve is a type error.
 *
 * It lives on the server side because that is where `AppType` is local. When the packaging
 * settles (see the spec's open question about the server becoming its own workspace package),
 * a consumer-side copy of this test belongs wherever the type edge lands.

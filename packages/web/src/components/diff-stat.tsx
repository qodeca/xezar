/**
 * `+128 −14` — a run's aggregate diff numbers, the mockup's `.adds`/`.dels` pair
 * (`tasks-home.html`): mono, tabular, adds in the success token, deletions in the danger token.
 * One component so the table's ± column, the sidebar quick-list and the mobile cards can never
 * disagree about what a diff stat looks like.
 *
 * Renders only when a `DiffStat` exists — the caller owns its own absent state (the table's
 * honest `—`, the quick-list's nothing), because what absence means differs per surface.
 * The `−` is U+2212 (minus sign), as in the mockup — a hyphen is not a math sign.
 *
 * `stat.repointed` (#751) marks a number measured against a branch the agent checked out into
 * the task's worktree — every review and QA run does that, and so does every skill that opens
 * its work on a named branch. Those runs used to report that branch's entire history as their
 * own; the number counts only what the run itself did to it now, but
 * it is right for a *different* reason than the one next to it, so it says so: a dotted
 * underline and `cursor-help` advertise the explanation, the `title` carries it, and
 * `data-repointed` lets a surface style or assert on it without re-deriving the rule.
 *
 * That caveat also gets an `aria-label`, which the plain case deliberately does NOT: `title`
 * is unreliable for screen readers and unreachable on touch, and here it carries meaning
 * (*what these numbers measure*) rather than a restatement of the visible text. Without it,
 * assistive tech would read the narrowed number as if it were an ordinary one.
 *
 * The wording is deliberately past-tense ("measured with…") rather than a claim about the
 * worktree right now. `diffStat` is a snapshot taken at turn-end and is never recomputed or
 * cleared afterwards — not when the run finishes, and not when retention reclaims the
 * worktree — so a present-tense sentence would keep asserting a checkout that may have
 * stopped existing hours ago. What the flag can honestly say is what was true when the
 * numbers were taken.

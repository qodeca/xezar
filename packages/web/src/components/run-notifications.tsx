/**
 * The notification trigger (R6 Step 1.7, spec §"Cross-cutting"): browser `Notification` when a
 * run ENTERS `waiting`/`review`/failed while the tab is hidden.
 *
 * It watches the cached run list rather than opening its own listener on `/api/events`: the
 * global stream (api/global-events.tsx) already folds every `run` event into
 * `queryKeys.runs.list()`, and the reconnect/visibility reconciliation refetches it — so one
 * cache subscription sees BOTH deliveries of the same truth. That second path is not a bonus,
 * it is the point: a hidden tab is exactly when the stream is most likely to have been frozen
 * (mobile background freeze, laptop lid), and the run that flipped to `waiting` while the socket
 * was dead arrives via the reconciling refetch, not via an event.
 *
 * Statuses are tracked UNCONDITIONALLY — before the enabled/hidden/permission gate — so flipping
 * the toggle on later, or refocusing the tab, never replays transitions that already happened:
 * the gate decides whether a transition becomes a notification, never whether it was observed.
 *
 * Renders nothing. Mounted once in app.tsx, beside the providers, for the app's whole life.

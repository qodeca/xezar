/**
 * The thread's stale-record healer.
 *
 * The doctrine (task-thread.tsx) splits the page across two feeds: `useRun` (fetch, patched by
 * the workspace stream) is authoritative for the record, `useRunEvents` (per-run SSE) is the
 * transcript. The two can drift: the per-run socket has its own liveness watchdog (#424) and a
 * full replay on reconnect, so the transcript recovers from anything — but a record update lost
 * on the workspace stream (a half-open socket, a dropped frame across a server restart) is gone
 * until something refetches. The thread then renders an impossible mix: the transcript says
 * "goal achieved — session closed" / "run finished" while the record still says `running`, so
 * the Working… spinner keeps spinning and the composer stays in live-session mode — whose sends
 * then 409 against the closed session.
 *
 * The transcript itself carries the truth, so use it: when the latest session boundary in the
 * event list is a `session.ended` and the record still claims a live session, the record is
 * stale — refetch it (the reconcile-on-reconnect doctrine, applied to the one seam reconnect
 * cannot see). A grace period keeps the healthy path quiet: `session.ended` always lands
 * moments before the workspace stream's own record update, and that update cancels the timer.

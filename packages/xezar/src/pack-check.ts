/** Tarball bundle check — the pure half of `scripts/check-pack.mjs`.
 *
 *  Phase R1 of the cockpit redesign shipped an npm tarball with no UI in it
 *  (`files` listed the sources, not the Vite build). This module pins that bug
 *  class: given the file list `npm pack --dry-run --json` reports, decide
 *  whether the package would ship a working cockpit. Kept dependency-free and
 *  side-effect-free so the decision is unit-testable; the script owns the
 *  `npm pack` invocation and the exit code.

 *  Requirements (spec `.ai/specs/2026-07-14-cockpit-ui-redesign.md`, Serving):

 *  - at least one `web/dist/assets/*` file — the hashed JS/CSS bundles; an
 *    index.html alone renders a blank page.

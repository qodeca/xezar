# Run: Cockpit UI redesign — specification + mockups

- Date: 2026-07-14
- Branch: `feat/cockpit-ui-redesign-spec`
- Base: `main`
- Type: docs/spec (no product code changes)
- Source brief: redesign the whole cezar cockpit UI/UX to leading-desktop-app parity using React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, keeping 100% of current functionality. Deliverable of THIS run is the specification (`.ai/specs/2026-07-14-cockpit-ui-redesign.md`) plus HTML mockups built with shadcn styling on real cezar data, with screenshots attached to the PR — so the spec can be approved visually and then implemented autonomously.

## Goal

Produce an implementation-ready, phased specification for the full UI redesign, grounded in research (leading agent desktop apps, opencode web, paseo, mercato-sandboxes visual language, agent event protocols incl. ACP), with high-fidelity HTML mockups and screenshots that prove the design direction.

## Decisions locked with the user (2026-07-14)

1. **UI stack**: full rewrite of `web/` as React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, compiled to static assets served by the existing Hono server; zero runtime deps for end users unchanged.
2. **Spec shape**: one master spec, phased; the normalized agent-event protocol, git GUI + forge drivers, and Settings tab are phases inside it.
3. **Git GUI depth**: review + ship actions (diffs, changes/files tab, commit, push, branch, View PR / create PR via driver) — no hunk staging, no rebase UI. Degrades to plain git when `gh` is absent; forge-driver seam for GitLab etc. later (GitHub-only for now, features hidden when no forge is available).

## Scope

- In: research notes (`.ai/analysis/`), the spec, HTML mockups (under `docs/mockups/`), screenshots (committed + attached to PR), no pipeline-file changes vs origin/main (the setup step regenerated them before discovering PR #343 had already bootstrapped the pipeline on origin/main; the branch restores the origin versions verbatim).
- Non-goals: NO changes to product code (`src/`, `web/`) in this run; no dependency changes; implementation happens in follow-up runs driven by the spec's Implementation Plan.

## Related issues

Folded into the spec as requirements: #390 (git integration look), #389 (task list: auto-summary titles, git +/- stats), #386 (full-screen new-task composer), #385 (searchable skills dropdown in GitHub tab), #383 (plan mode not marked selected), #382 (TODO/plan checkbox lists), #381 (tool-result display), #380 (skills autocomplete), #378 (dark-mode selector clipped), #377 (project skills first/bold).

## Risks

- Research sources (vendor desktop apps, external repos) are external; findings recorded to `.ai/analysis/` so the spec stays reviewable offline.
- Mockups are static HTML approximations of the future React app — close enough for visual approval, not pixel-contracts.
- The local checkout was behind origin/main, which hid PR #343's existing pipeline bootstrap; the run initially regenerated the process docs and later restored the origin/main versions (commit history keeps both). Validation gate = `npm run typecheck` + `npm run build` (docs-only run: gate proves the repo stays healthy).

## Progress

PR: #395 (supersedes #393 — closed by the de-branding branch rename; review trail lives on #393)

# Canonical quality evidence

Run repo-gates.sh --fast, inspect complete durable logs through bounded excerpts, repair the solution within stage authority at most two times for the same failure, then report hypothesis/attempts/command/revision/blocker. Never suppress failures, lower thresholds or mark missing/skipped checks passed. Seal only with worktree-preflight.sh --record-gate-evidence on unchanged committed content; verify independently before delivery. This standalone skill is legitimate without direct YAML reachability.

## Shared contract

Before reading kit files in a standalone skill run, if `.xezar/checks/bootstrap.sh` is absent, run `bash "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/../.xezar/checks/bootstrap.sh"`. If unavailable or refused, stop with that specific blocker. Never fabricate commands or copy runtime. Workflow launches already perform this step.

Read `AGENTS.md`, `SDLC.md`, `CODE_REVIEW.md`, `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` and `.xezar/docs/README.md`. Root rules and the current authorized task govern. Workflows snapshot the local kit before work; do not create/adopt another task branch or change a peer's checkout. Use current task identity, not a remembered working directory. Read the task's current checkpoint and late steering before resume or handoff.

The leader owns the goal/plan and adjudication. Specialists own technical evidence and findings. Ask only for a genuinely missing decision outside existing authority, using `XEZ:ASK` with options and custom answer in an interactive terminal agent step. Silence is not authority. Record unresolved dependent work in the primary evidence directory's `BLOCKED` file so readiness cannot pass. Independent work may continue. Never waive mandatory quality/AC. Project operations within the authorized plan need no repeated permission; this is not permission to publish when the current assignment excludes it.

Writing-stage ownership: implement all code/tests/docs/release metadata, focused tests, self-review and focused commits before full gates. Run only `.xezar/checks/repo-gates.sh --fast` for final canonical evidence. Do not repeat the entire gate list in every agent step. Gate repair returns are at most two; quality-gates allows at most two repairs of the same failure. Preserve history when changing executors; no invented global retry allowance.

Derive durable evidence with `.xezar/checks/lib/common.sh` (`resolve_task_paths`, `task_evidence_dir`): primary `.local/xezar-tasks/<runId>/`, not the task's reclaimable `.local` or engine tmp. Keep checkpoints concise. Never copy secrets, credentials, `.env`, personal agent configuration or unrelated source content. Reports distinguish observed, fixture-tested, live-verified and unknown. Record relevant dogfooding observations using `.xezar/docs/dogfooding.md`.
